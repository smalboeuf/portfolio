        <h2>About Me.</h2>
        <p>I am a technology enthusiast who strives to create. </p>
        <p> I have always been driven to learn
        more about tech and understand how to create successful outcomes. I consider myself
        dedicated learner who is passionate and knowledgeable about software and game
        development programming. I first got into coding through programming video games in
        C# and was immediately excited by the idea of being able to execute the creative ideas
        that I came up with. This feeling remains with me to this day and has guided me to
        wanting to code full-time.
